We have adapted this by adding low-level implementation details for some of the decoding strategies (we provide solutions for the first three methods. If you are interested in the remainder, you can find the details in `transformers.generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate`). The best way to learn programming in general, and particularly trying to understand deep learning models and methods, is to dive into existing implementations and try to reimplement them independently. The functions we ask the students to complete below are stripped down versions of the Huggingface decoding methods. Hope you enjoy! :)"

The results on conditioned open-ended language generation are impressive, e.g. [GPT2 on unicorns](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#samples), [XLNet](https://medium.com/@amanrusia/xlnet-speaks-comparison-to-gpt-2-ea1a4e9ba39e), [Controlled language with CTRL](https://blog.einstein.ai/introducing-a-conditional-transformer-language-model-for-controllable-generation/). Besides the improved transformer architecture and massive unsupervised training data, **better decoding methods** have also played an important role. \n",

        "As *ad-hoc* decoding methods, *top-p* and *top-K* sampling seem to produce more fluent text than traditional *greedy* - and *beam* search on open-ended language generation. \n",
        "Recently, there has been more evidence though that the apparent flaws of *greedy* and *beam* search - mainly generating repetitive word sequences - are  caused by the model (especially the way the model is trained), rather than the decoding method, *cf.* [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf). Also, as demonstrated in [Welleck et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02492), it looks as *top-K* and *top-p* sampling also suffer from generating repetitive word sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf), the authors show that according to human evaluations, *beam* search can generate more fluent text than *Top-p* sampling, when adapting the model's training objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open-ended language generation is a rapidly evolving field of research and as it is often the case there is no one-size-fits-all method here, so one has to see what works best in one's specific use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Good thing, that *you* can try out all the different decoding methods in `transfomers` 🤗. \n",
        "\n",
        "That was a short introduction on how to use different decoding methods in `transformers` and recent trends in open-ended language generation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Feedback and questions are very welcome on the [Github repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).\n",

        "- `min_length` can be used to force the model to not produce an EOS token (= not finish the sentence) before `min_length` is reached. This is used quite frequently in summarization, but can be useful in general if the user wants to have longer outputs.\n",
        "- `repetition_penalty` can be used to penalize words that were already generated or belong to the context. It was first introduced by [Kesker et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858) and is also used in the training objective in [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf). It can be quite effective at preventing repetitions, but seems to be very sensitive to different models and use cases, *e.g.* see this [discussion](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/2303) on Github.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `attention_mask` can be used to mask padded tokens\n",
